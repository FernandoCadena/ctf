  In an effort to follow good security practices, defund set
  up SSH keys for his server, which he connects to at
  `ctf@web.angstromctf.com:3004`. kmh11 managed to get the
  [public key]({{ id_rsa.pub }}) and part of the
  [private key]({{ id_rsa }}). Help him ruin defund's life. 
hint: Good luck!
