The object of this challenge is to decrypt `flag.png.enc`, which was encrypted with `encrypt.py`. The encryption appears to be a stream cipher. Unfortunately, the stream is not properly randomized; every 4 bytes is the output of a linear congruential generator (LCG).

The LCG's parameters are largely unknown, with the exception of the modulus. However, it is possible to recover the others with three consecutive outputs of the LCG; see `source/decrypt.py` for details. We can obtain these three outputs from the known header data of a `PNG` file, which we xor with `flag.png.enc` to produce part of the keystream.

Given that we know all of the LCG parameters, we can produce the rest of the keystream, xor it with `flag.png.enc`, and decrypt the file. A full solve script is in `source/decrypt.py`.
